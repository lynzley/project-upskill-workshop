## Words of Wisdom
- Do not wait until you're applying to jobs to start networking!
- You want to develop these connections now so you feel comfortable asking them for a referral a couple months down the road.

## Sending a connection request

1. State the connection you have with them.
2. Include something personal to show that you did research.
3. Make it kind (why, specifically, do you want to connect with them?)

## A couple things to keep in mind:
1. If they don't respond, that's okay!.
2. Interns are a really great first connection at a company you're interested in.
3. Don't undervalue yourself.
