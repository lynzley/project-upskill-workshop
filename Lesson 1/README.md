# Lesson 1: Who are you?

## Introduction
As an individual or with a group of people, ask yourselves the following questions:
What are soft skills?
Which ones am I good at?
Which ones could I improve in?

## Learning Activity
Employers have identified the following soft skills as being the most important in the workplace:
Integrity
Communication
Courtesy
Responsibility
Social Skills
Positive attitude
Professionalism
Flexibility
Teamwork
Work Ethic

To determine your strengths and weaknesses, youâ€™re going to rank these soft skills by your test results in the following personality quiz. Follow this [link](https://www.viacharacter.org/survey/account/register), make an account, and take 10 minutes to fill out the questionnaire. Once the questionnaire is complete, record your ranking for the 24 character strengths. Take special note of your **Signature Strengths**, **Middle Strengths**, and **Lesser Strengths**.

Write down or type your 24 character strengths in order.


Review the list of top ten top skills. How would you rank these compared to your character strengths. Write or type this down as well?


## Conclusion
Once again, ask yourselves the following questions individually or with a group?
What are my top strengths? How can I use these to be a better professional?
What are my weaknesses? How could they be hindering my ability to be a good professional?
How can I address my weaknesses and improve?
