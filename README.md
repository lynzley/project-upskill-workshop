## Project Overview
A **soft skill** gap is growing between college grads and future emplowers, disproportionality affecting **first-generation** college students. We aim to close this gap by creating **3 workshops** targetting three key areas in supporting the growth of student's soft skills. Each workshop can be included individually or through a cohort and includes pre- and post-lesson exercises, written instructions to complete the lesson, a slide deck, and more.
