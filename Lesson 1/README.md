# Lesson 1: Who are you?

## Introduction
As an individual or with a group of people, ask yourselves the following questions:
1. What are soft skills?
2. Which ones am I good at?
3. Which ones could I improve in?

## Learning Activity
- Employers have identified the following soft skills as being the most important in the workplace:
- Integrity
- Communication
- Courtesy
- Responsibility
- Social Skills
- Positive attitude
- Professionalism
- Flexibility
- Teamwork
- Work Ethic

To determine your strengths and weaknesses, youâ€™re going to rank these soft skills by your test results in the following personality quiz. Follow this [link](https://www.viacharacter.org/survey/account/register), make an account, and take 10 minutes to fill out the questionnaire. Once the questionnaire is complete, record your ranking for the 24 character strengths. Take special note of your **Signature Strengths**, **Middle Strengths**, and **Lesser Strengths**.

Write down or type your 24 character strengths in order.

3. How can I address my weaknesses and improve?
