# LinkedIn Personal Branding Workshop

## Slide 1
Welcome to Women in Informatic’s Building Your LinkedIn Brand workshop!
Presented by me, Winfo’s Hackathon Director.
This event has been curated by 2 LinkedIn Profile Events created by Personal Brand experts, many hours of personal research, and reviewed by the iSchool’s very own Caitlin Goldbaum so I guarantee this is going to be an amazing event.
Feel free to take notes and screenshots throughout the presentation--we want you to have this information.

## Slide 2
We’re going to start with an icebreaker
And hint: this is how you’ll get Starbucks Giftcards, by participating throughout the event.
What I want to know is what is your most interesting/coolest/unique hobby?
I’ll give you 30 seconds to think about it and then we’ll take 2 volunteers.
Take two volunteers
Even if you didn’t volunteer, hold on to this fun fact, we’ll be using it later.

## Slide 3
Because this is a Winfo event, we’re going to cover some stats of Women in Technology
Women now hold a lower share of technical jobs than they did in the 1980's
U.S. women working in science and high-tech fields are 45% more likely that their male peers to leave the industry within a year, often due to gender bias
Women get less access to senior leaders than men do. Yet employees who interact regularly with senior leaders are more likely to ask for and receive promotions, stay at their companies, and aspire to be leaders.
Why is this important? It means that there is still a lot of work be done, and women and any minorities and tech need to be even more committed to their personal and professional brand.

## Slide 4
What is a personal brand?
“A personal brand is what people say about you when you leave the room.”
It is what sets you out in the crowd.
It’s how people remember you.

## Slide 5
I’m going to given some really great advice.
First, have your LinkedIn Profile open and be making these changes now. If you don’t do it right now, you probably never will.
Second, one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever personally received is I don’t need to follow everyone’s advice--because you’re going to get a lot of it. Take the ideas that you like and if something doesn’t feel right, don’t feel any pressure to add it.
For realsies now, let’s get to the actual content

## Slide 6
First things first: customize your LinkedIn URL!
This is really easy to do
Go to your profile and click the tab in the top right corner that says: Edit public profile & URL
At this point, you can customize this
This is really important because LinkedIn automatically gives you a really long and messy URL which is hard to fit on resumes and makes it really hard to find you.

## Slide 7
Next, let’s look at Profile pictures.
I have to say, when I was making this presentation, I was looking at a bunch of different executives I admired and realized they were mostly men!
Then, I realized this was a WOMEN in Informatics event so I went back and did some serious research of some awesome Women Leaders.
All of these women follow the guidelines really well.
First, their photo reflects the industry they are in
The techy companies are a little more casual and the other companies are a but more professional
This is something to keep in mind: if your dream job is to be a software engineer at a tech company, you can probably get away with a less professional photo
However, if you want to go into consulting or a more professional field, you’ll want to put some more effort in getting a really crisp, professional photo of yourself.
Next, avoid cropped photos.
Occasionally, you’ll see a photo on LinkedIn where it was pretty clear it was a group that they just cropped
And you can see other peoples arms and shoulders in the photo
If this is all you have, it’s better than nothing, but definitely look into refreshing that as soon as possible.
The next thing we’re going to cover is really interesting
I was talking to a recruiter, and he said that he could tell within 10 seconds whether someone had put effort in developing their personal brand
Hint, only one of the profiles I’m showing you right now has it

## Slide 8
If you guessed cover photo, your correct!
Check out all of these amazing cover photos.
First, let’s look at Reshma Saujani, the CEO and FOunder of Girls Who Code.
She’s using her cover to advertise her book.
And you probably can’t see it, but the shirt she is wearing also has Brave, Not Perfect written on it!
And, she also has a TED Talk about the idea of women being Brave, not Perfect.
This is one of the best examples of personal brand because she has spent years curating it, and it has definitely paid off.
Next, let’s look at Pamela Maynard, the CEO of Avanda
Avanade is pretty unique because their brand color is orange.
Apparently, they use this same orange wave on all of their internal powerpoints!
I personally love how her profile pic literally has orange in it to connect to her cover photo.
Next up is Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors.
In her cover photo, it looks like those are either electric or self-driving cars. She’s using her cover photo to represent GM as a future-forward company.
Finally, we have Julie Sweet, the CEO of Accenture
Fun fact: she has just been named the Most Influential Businesswomen of 2020.
I love how her background acknowledges the current world and even through the quarantine and stay at home earliers, they’re staying together.
Okay, these were all awesome examples
But let’s face it: they probably all had marketing and design teams to help them with these.
You can easily turn your background into either
A photo of your college campus
A photo of the city you live in
If you have an action photo of yourself at a conference or giving a presentation, that’s also really good
If you have some extra time
Try using a tool like Canva which provides banners that you can customize

## Slide 9
Next up is your name!
You want your name to be how you introduce yourself as. 
For example, if Pamela Maynard actually goes by Pam, she should use that?
Wy? It let’s your network and recruiters know how to refer to you from the very beginning.
Second, LinkedIn has been rolling out a new tool that helps with pronouncing your name.
If you want to activate this, make sure that the pronunciation is accurate before it goes live on your profile.

## Slide 10
Now let’s look at your headline! Your headline is really important.
The biggest thing you want to avoid is cookie cutter titles such as Student at the University of Washington.
There are two reasons for this
First, there are 40,000 other students at the University of Washington. You want to use LinkedIn to differentiate yourself, not blend in.
Second, you want your title to be future-focused. And this is straight from Caitlin Goldbaum: You want to use the headline to show an employer where you are going, not where you are right now. If you brand yourself as a student, that is all an employer will see you as, rather than a viable candidate for a job.
Second, you want to consider the Search Engine Optimization and use key words in your profile
Recruiters search for candidates by filtering for skills. If you don’t have your skills listed, the recruiters won’t even be able to find you.
For example, my current title includes Women in Informatics Hackathon Director. If I wanted recruiters to be able to find me for a career I’d be interested in, I’d change this to Hackathon Program or Product Manager.
This is a good framework that you can use for inspiration
FInd something you’re an expert in, you’re passion, your official job title
We’re going to pause here for two minutes and take some time to develop some good headlines.
If you need some inspiration, check out this photo from my connections which I thought had mostly solid headlines.

## Slide 11
This nearly concludes our discussion about your LinkedIn header
Here are some final considerations
Make sure your school and work is accurate
I was on my LinkedIn a month ago and realized my School wasn’t visible. Go into settings and opt in to making this visible.
Second, make sure your location is a place recruiters know
I was on my LinkedIn a week ago and realized it put my location as Bothell, Washington.
This is problematic because a recruiter in San Francisco or New York City probably won’t know to look for a candidate in Bothell as they’ve probably never heard of the place.
You want your location to be somewhere someone from outside of our state would know, such as the Greater Seattle Area.

## Slide 12
Now, let’s dive into the About Section. THe About Section is one of the most important sections of your LinkedIn
This is your expanded elevator pitch to your network and recruiters
This is also where you need to include keywords of the skills and positions you’re looking to do in an internship or job
There are a lot of ways to do this, this is one
First, what do you do right now?
What gives you the business to do it?
How are you qualified?
What do you like about it?
Who are you outside of work?
A few other ways you can break this up:
Discuss your past, your present, and where you’re looking to go
Tell your unique story.

## Slide 13
Let’s practice
Use whatever framework you like most
Take 30 minutes to make a draft and don't aim for perfection. You can always update your profile.
