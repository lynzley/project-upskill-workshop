# What is Project Upskill?
Project Upskill is an iSchool Capstone Project that develeloped 2 workshops to help first-generation college students develop their soft skills. We have created two workshops, a LinkedIn Personal Branding Workshop and a Networking Workshop, to help students succeed in these areas. Each workshop includes:
1. A completed slide deck that can be edited for your organization
2. Speaker notes
3. A website where students can follow the workshops individually

# Who is it for?
Project Upskill was especially designed to help bridge the gap for first-generation college students. With that said, the material is also good for any student new to LinkedIn and professional networking. We ask that organizations who use our content ensure they're reaching the underrepresented, first-generation college students in their community.

# How can I use it?
If you are an organization leader, you can use the material provided to give your own workshops!

If you are a student, you can follow the workshops on your own to improve your soft skills.

If you are a Capstone Team with the iSchool (or any person looking to help this project), you can contribute your own workshops and help Project Upskill grow.

# How can I contribute to it?
During our Capstone, we conducted research on the followint areas and believe workshops could be made in these categories that would significantly help students. In some of these ideas, we have links to the first drafts you can use as a foundation for a new workshop.
