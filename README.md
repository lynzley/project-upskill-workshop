## Project Overview
A **soft skill** gap is growing between college grads and future employers, disproportionality affecting **first-generation** college students. We aim to close this gap by creating **2 workshops** targetting key areas in supporting the growth of student's soft skills. Each workshop can be included individually or through a cohort and includes pre- and post-lesson exercises, written instructions to complete the lesson, a slide deck, and more.

## Key features
Currently, Project Upskill provides two workshops: a LinkedIn Personal Branding Workshop and a Networking Workshop. Each workshop includes:

- A completed slide deck that can be edited for your organization
- Speaker notes
- A website where students can follow the workshops individually


We are only in phase 1 of developing this project, which means that there are more workshops and learning opportunities to come!
